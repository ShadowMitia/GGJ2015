It's a story about people who wanted to earn more... In a crew there is a manager and some workers who collected resources. Workers tell manager when a resource is collected and the manager takes the count on his tablet. Finally after this frenetic time, the manager give performancer reviews of the crew, then workers vote to keep or not the manager. If the manager is voted out, then the player with the highest resource value gets promoted. The game ends if the amount of resources collected and the amount of resources checked in by the manger is too different, or the overall value goal is reached.
